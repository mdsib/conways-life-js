#Conway's Game of Life
##Implemented using canvas, vanilla javascript, css, and html

##Installation
Just clone the repo and fire up your favorite static html server. Or just open index.html in a browser.

##TO DO
I used jasmine for testing early in this app's development. Need to implement either a headless browser or a virtual DOM, like phantomjs or jsdom, to support window and document objects.
